Forecasting the 2018 U.S. Senate Elections 

The Democrats have a good probability of winning the House of Representatives but are unlikely to win back the Senate. This will leave them in better shape than after the 2016 election but still limits their voting power.  

This article will focus on a Senate forecast model and potential scenarios that would give the Democrats enough seats to oust the Republicans from Senate control. 

First off, our Senate forecast is trained on 2012, 2014, and 2016 Senate elections. For each state, we averaged the final margin, percentage of Republican and Democratic votes, and standard error from each poll using data from RealClearPolitics.com. 

A second version of this model will create an adjusted poll index based on the margin error between each pollâ€™s prediction and final result. 

It might also be useful to account for geographical voting patterns surrounding a given state. For example, Georgia would fall in the Republican cluster of states as it lies near conservative strongholds such as Mississippi and Alabama compared to New York or Rhode Island, which are geographically closer to other Democratic leaning states.
